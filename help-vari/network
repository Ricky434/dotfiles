If you want to use wifi instead of ethernet while having both connected you have to change their route metrics

One way to do it is through NetworkManager (another is through ip route probably)
Don't use the gui, it's stupid. Use nmcli connection modify and set ipv4/ipv6.route-metric

Se la connessione droppa ogni qualche secondo molto probabilmente e' perche il segnale fa schifo (probabilmente stai usando 5Ghz)
