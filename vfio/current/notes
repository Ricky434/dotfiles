# Make vfio take over the nvidia gpu before nvidia drivers
1. Add vfio modules in mkinitcpio before nvidia as wiki says
2. Set ids of gpu that will be claimed by vfio in modprobe.d/vfio.conf
3. Rebuild initframs

No need to blacklist nvidia modules on boot

If virtiofs (shared filesystem) seems not to be working, even after installing all drivers
it could be that you have to enable the VirtIO-FS windows service

If network is not working, it could be blocked by your firewall. To try set FORWARD chain to accept

Useful kernel parameters:
pci=noats # do not use pcie ats (and IOMMU device IOTLB) (dont know if I should set it or not)
pcie_aspm=off # disable pcie active state power management. Could work to prevent random vm crashes (I have to test it)
